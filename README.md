# Adventure

In this project the Crowther's Adventure game implemented on behalf of the programming minor at the UvA. It is a text-based game that prints the full text on the screen. The game can be played by entering the commands in the terminal to navigate through the file system. 

## Background

One such game is Colossal Cave Adventure, created by William Crowther in 1975. This game served as inspiration for the entire genre of text adventures. The commands a player enters in Adventure could be words like "IN" and "OUT", or perhaps "WEST" and "EAST", each suggesting a direction taken to navigate the "virtual world".
